    <h1> Long-Range 3D Scanning </h1>
    <h3> Fast, Metrology-Grade Capture of Large Objects </h3>
    <p> A long-range scanner has a very large field of view and is the ideal solution for digitally capturing
large areas fast and with maximum accuracy. Tripod mounted, the scanner should be moved to
different positions around the object in order to scan from multiple angles. </p>
